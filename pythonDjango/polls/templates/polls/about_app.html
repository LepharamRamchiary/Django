    <p>In Django, the startapp command is used to create a new application within a project, providing a structured way to organize and develop specific functionalities. An app in Django is a modular component that encapsulates features such as models, views, templates, and static files, making it reusable and maintainable. To create an app, run python manage.py startapp appname, which generates a directory with essential files like models.py, views.py, admin.py, and apps.py. After creating the app, you must add it to the INSTALLED_APPS list in the project's settings.py file to integrate it into the project. This modularity allows developers to build scalable and feature-rich web applications efficiently.</p>
